## Vercel API Template for OpenAI GPT Models

This repository contains a template for setting up a Vercel API using Python to interact with OpenAI's GPT models. The template provides a basic structure to build, deploy, and run a scalable API for integrating GPT-powered features into your applications.

### Features

- Python-based API setup.
- Integration with OpenAI GPT models.
- Scalable architecture suitable for Vercel deployment.
  
### Account Setup

Before you can utilize this Vercel API template with OpenAI's GPT models, you need to set up accounts on GitHub, Vercel, and have a ChatGPT Plus account with OpenAI.

#### Creating a GitHub Account

1. **Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).**
2. **Click on 'Sign up'.**
3. **Fill in the registration form with your details.**
4. **Verify your email address to complete the account setup.**

#### Creating a Vercel Account

1. **Visit [Vercel's website](https://vercel.com/).**
2. **Click 'Sign Up'.**
3. **You can sign up using your GitHub account or with an email address.**
4. **Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.**

#### Getting ChatGPT Plus Account with OpenAI

1. **Go to [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com/).**
2. **Sign up for an account if you don't already have one.**
3. **Upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for access to the GPT API.**
4. **Once you have the Plus account, navigate to the API section and generate an API key.**

### Installation and Setup

After setting up your accounts, follow these steps to install Visual Studio Code, download the repository, and prepare your API.

#### Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

1. **Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).**
2. **Download the version appropriate for your operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux).**
3. **Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.**

#### Download the Repository to Your Local Drive

1. **Navigate to the GitHub repository in your web browser.**
2. **Click on the 'Code' button and then choose 'Download ZIP'.**
3. **Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to your desired location on your local drive.**

#### Open the Project in VS Code

1. **Right-click on the project directory (the folder where you extracted the repository).**
2. **Select 'Open with VS Code'.**

#### Prepare the API Template

1. **In VS Code, open the `api` directory in the project.**
2. **Locate and open the `main.py` file.**

#### Utilize ChatGPT for API Development

1. **Copy the contents of `main.py`.**
2. **Consult ChatGPT, providing the copied code, and describe the specific API functionality you wish to develop.**
   - For example, "Here's a Python template for a Vercel API. I want to create an API that does X, Y, and Z. Can you help modify this template?"

### Updating Your GitHub Repository

After developing and testing your API, the next step is to update your GitHub repository with your latest code. GitHub Desktop provides a user-friendly interface to manage your repositories. Here are the steps to initialize your project as a Git repository, commit your changes, and push them to GitHub using GitHub Desktop.

#### Install GitHub Desktop

1. **Go to the [GitHub Desktop website](https://desktop.github.com/).**
2. **Download the version appropriate for your operating system (Windows or MacOS).**
3. **Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.**

#### Creating a New Repository in GitHub Desktop

1. **Open GitHub Desktop.**
2. **Click on 'File', then select 'New Repository'.**
3. **Fill in the details for your new repository, such as 'Name', 'Local Path', and 'Description'.**
4. **Make sure to select 'Initialize this repository with a README'.**
5. **Click 'Create Repository' to create your new repository.**

#### Copying the Template Repository into Your New Repository

1. **Open the folder where you extracted the Vercel API template.**
2. **Copy all the files and folders from this template directory.**
3. **Navigate to the local directory of the new repository you created in GitHub Desktop.**
4. **Paste all the copied files from the template into this directory.**

#### Committing and Pushing Changes with GitHub Desktop

1. **Open GitHub Desktop; it should automatically detect the changes in your repository.**
2. **In the left-hand sidebar, you'll see a list of changed files. Review these to ensure they are the correct changes you want to commit.**
3. **At the bottom, provide a summary of the changes in the 'Summary' field and optionally a more detailed description in the 'Description' field.**
4. **Click 'Commit to main' to stage your changes.**
5. **Once committed, click 'Publish repository' or 'Push origin' to push your changes to the remote GitHub repository.**

#### Linking to Vercel

1. **Go to [Vercel's website](https://vercel.com/) and log in to your account.**
2. **On the Vercel dashboard, click on 'New Project'.**
3. **Vercel will prompt you to import a project from GitHub. Click 'Import' next to the repository you want to deploy.**
4. **If you're linking to Vercel for the first time, you may need to install the Vercel for GitHub integration and authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account.**

#### Configuring Your Project on Vercel

1. **After selecting your repository, you'll be taken to the 'Import Project' page.**
2. **Here, you can configure your project settings. For most Python-based APIs, the default settings should work fine.**
3. **Set the 'Framework Preset' to 'Other' or the specific framework if it's listed.**
4. **You can also configure environment variables if your project requires them under the 'Environment Variables' section.**

#### Deploying Your Project

1. **Once you've configured your project settings, click on the 'Deploy' button at the bottom of the page.**
2. **Vercel will then begin the deployment process. You can monitor the progress in the 'Deployments' tab of your Vercel dashboard.**
3. **When the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide a URL where your deployed project is accessible.**
